ZCorp Printer Accessories
=========================

Some accessories I have printed for my ZCorp devices

`z310_binder_tube_clip.scad`
---------------------------

Used to hold the binder tube up and away from the fast axis head,
useful if you have needed to replace your binder line with a
more flexible replacement.

Print with a FFM printer, and mount on top of the slow axis.
Clip the binder line into the C shaped holder.
